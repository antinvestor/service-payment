# Service Payment Repository

This repository contains the Service Payment application, a robust platform built using **Golang** and **gRPC**. The application is designed to handle various payment transactions efficiently, including sending and receiving payments.

## Key Features
- **Transaction Management**: Supports sending and receiving payments with detailed transaction tracking.
- **gRPC Integration**: Utilizes gRPC for efficient communication between services.
- **Docker Support**: Easily deployable using Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Modular Architecture**: Designed for scalability and maintainability.
- **Automated Dependency Management**: Uses Dependabot for automatic dependency updates with smart auto-merge.

## Automated Dependency Management

This repository uses **Dependabot** for automated dependency management with the following features:

### ü§ñ What Gets Updated Automatically
- **Go Dependencies**: Both `apps/default` and `apps/integrations/jenga-api` modules are monitored
- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow dependencies are kept up-to-date
- **Grouped Updates**: Related dependencies (like antinvestor APIs) are grouped together

### üöÄ Auto-merge Behavior
- **‚úÖ Auto-merged**: Minor and patch updates that pass all CI tests
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Manual review**: Major version updates (may contain breaking changes)
- **üõ°Ô∏è Safety**: Only Dependabot PRs that pass comprehensive CI checks are auto-merged

### üìÖ Update Schedule
- **Go dependencies**: Weekly updates
- **GitHub Actions**: Daily updates  
- **Pull request limit**: Max 10 open PRs per ecosystem

### üîß CI Pipeline
Every Dependabot PR goes through:
1. **Build verification** for both Go modules
2. **Test execution** with proper environment setup
3. **Code linting** using golangci-lint
4. **Race condition detection** in tests
5. **Dependency verification**

The CI pipeline is designed to handle the monorepo structure with parallel testing of both modules.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Docker**: Required for containerized deployment.
- **Golang**: Necessary for local development and running the service.
- **grpcurl**: Useful for testing gRPC endpoints.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/service-payment.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd service-payment
   ```
3. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t service-payment:latest .
   ```
4. Start the services using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Usage
- The service is accessible via HTTP on `localhost:8020` and gRPC on `localhost:50051`.
- Use `grpcurl` to test gRPC endpoints.
